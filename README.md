# Network-Intrusion-Detection
AI Driven Intrusion Detection For University Network Traffic With Cloud Deployment


Abstract
This project focuses on developing an advanced system for capturing and analyzing network packets within a university environment to enhance security through intrusion detection. Initially, the system will collect and inspect real-time network traffic using packet-capturing tools such as Scapy, extracting critical features like packet size, protocol type, and source/destination details. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system will classify network traffic and detect potential threats or anomalies, ensuring proactive network defense. In the final phase, the solution will be deployed on a cloud platform, enabling scalable and efficient monitoring for large volumes of data. By combining real-time analysis, intelligent detection mechanisms, and cloud deployment, this project aims to create a robust intrusion detection system tailored to the university's network infrastructure, ensuring both security and performance optimization.
